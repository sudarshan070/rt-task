# #1: React App for WordCamp Schedule Viewer

#### Problem Statement

Please create a React App which fetches data using WP REST API using WordCamp Central site. The lack of links to WP REST API documentation is on purpose. You should be able to find your way to documentation and a bit of how WordPress works (hint: custom post type).

Regarding functionality of your app, display upcoming and past WordCamps in:

1. calendar view. Something like Google Calendar.

2. (optional) map view. You may need to use another API for maps. You can ignore this feature if you are short on the time.

Your app will be view only as there is no write operation.

For design as in UI/UX, be imaginative.

For CSS feel free to use frameworks.

#### Submission Guidelines

1. Write test cases using JEST or Enzyme. Your code should have min 60% test coverage.

2. You should not use any React framework. Not even create-react-app.

3. Source Code Hosting ➞ You must use Github (recommended) or Gitlab for source code hosting.

4. App Hosting for demo ➞ As your app work doesn’t have any server-side component development — besides WordCamp site which is already publicly hosted — you should be able to use Github pages. You can even try Vercel or any other hosting of your choice.
