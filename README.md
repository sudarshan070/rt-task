# #1: React App for WordCamp Schedule Viewer

#### Problem Statement

Please create a React App which fetches data using WP REST API using WordCamp Central site. The lack of links to WP REST API documentation is on purpose. You should be able to find your way to documentation and a bit of how WordPress works (hint: custom post type).

Regarding functionality of your app, display upcoming and past WordCamps in:

1. calendar view. Something like Google Calendar.

2. (optional) map view. You may need to use another API for maps. You can ignore this feature if you are short on the time.

App will be view only as there is no write operation.

For design as in UI/UX, be imaginative.

For CSS feel free to use frameworks.

### Tech
1. This is server side application.
2. Webpack configuration.
3. React
4. React Hooks
5. axios
6. Test cases using JEST or Enzyme
7. Bootsrap
8. API :- https://central.wordcamp.org/wp-json/wp/v2/wordcamps.
